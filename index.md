I believe that our experiences abroad open the doors to new opportunities. I believe that everyone can benefit from their own unique and personal experience abroad. I believe that our experiences abroad have the ability to empower ourselves. Whether it be for study, work, research, or purposeful travel, what matters is that these experiences are known and accessible. That is where I come in.

I am currently the Engineering Abroad Advisor in the Office of Global Engineering Leadership at the A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD, where I advise outgoing and incoming exchange students and support courses in our Global Engineering Leadership minor.

I hold two master's degrees from the International Education Management and Public Administration joint degree program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. As part of my graduate work, I completed a practicum in education abroad advising at Portland Community College's Education Abroad Office from July through December 2018. I also completed the Frontier Market Scouts Certificate in Social Enterprise Management and Impact Investing and DPMI Certificate in International Development and Social Change during my time at MIIS.

Prior to arriving at the Institute, I worked in college recruiting in Israel, as a teacher in Milwaukee, and as an English instructor in the Czech Republic on the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant program. I earned my BA at the University of California, San Diego, where I also had the opportunity to study abroad for a semester at Charles University in Prague.

My teaching experience additionally includes serving as a teaching assistant for the University of Maryland's ENES 317: Introduction to Engineering Leadership (Spring 2019) and ENES 472: International Business Cultures in Engineering and Technology (Spring 2019), as well as the Middlebury Institute's IEMG 8510: International Education Program Design and Assessment (Spring 2018) and IEMG 8511: Logic Model Framework for International Education (Spring 2018).
