I previously served as the Engineering Abroad Advisor in the [Office of Global Engineering Leadership](https://eng.umd.edu/global) at the [A. James Clark School of Engineering](https://eng.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu) in College Park, MD, where I advised outgoing and incoming exchange students and supported courses in our Global Engineering Leadership minor.

I hold two master's degrees from the [International Education Management and Public Administration](https://www.miis.edu/academics/programs/education-management/joint-degree) joint degree program at the [Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey](https://www.miis.edu). As part of my graduate work, I completed a practicum in education abroad advising at [Portland Community College's Education Abroad Office](https://www.pcc.edu/education-abroad/) from July through December 2018. I also completed the Frontier Market Scouts Certificate in Social Enterprise Management and Impact Investing and DPMI Certificate in International Development and Social Change during my time at MIIS.

Prior to arriving at the Institute, I worked in college recruiting in Israel, as a teacher in Milwaukee, and as an English instructor in the Czech Republic on the [Fulbright English Teaching Assistant program](https://www.fulbright.cz/en/fulbright-scholarships/fulbright-english-teaching-assistants/). I earned my BA at the [University of California, San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu), where I also had the opportunity to study abroad for a semester at Charles University in Prague.

My teaching experience additionally includes serving as a teaching assistant for the University of Maryland's [ENES 317: Introduction to Engineering Leadership](https://eng.umd.edu/global/leadership-courses/enes317) (Spring 2019) and [ENES 472: International Business Cultures in Engineering and Technology](https://eng.umd.edu/global/leadership-courses/enes472) (Spring 2019), as well as the Middlebury Institute's [IEMG 8510: International Education Program Design and Assessment](https://courses.middlebury.edu/hub/miis/201828/iemg/8510b) (Spring 2018) and [IEMG 8511: Logic Model Framework for International Education](https://courses.middlebury.edu/hub/miis/201828/iemg/8511b) (Spring 2018).
